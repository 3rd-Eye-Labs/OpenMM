# OpenMM - Cardano's Universal Market Making Toolkit

OpenMM is an open-source SDK designed to democratize market-making for Cardano projects. It provides a unified interface for trading Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs) across multiple centralized exchanges.

## What is OpenMM?

Traditional market-making services are expensive and fragmented, making it difficult for smaller Cardano projects to maintain healthy liquidity. OpenMM solves this by offering:

- **Multi-Exchange Support**: Trade on MEXC, Gate.io, Bitget, Kraken and more through a single interface
- **Advanced Strategies**: Grid trading, liquidity provision, and dynamic rebalancing
- **Complete CNT Integration**: Full support for Cardano Native Tokens

This toolkit aims to improve liquidity for Cardano projects, reduce trading spreads, and potentially become the standard liquidity infrastructure for the Cardano ecosystem.
